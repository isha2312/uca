Puzzles

1. Guess hat colour

 strategy:
1.The strategy is to count the number of white and black hats in front of them and say white if number of white hats are odd 
  else say black.
2.Now the 10th prisoner will count the white hats in front and if the count is even he will say white otherwise black. 
3.Now the 9th prisoner will also count the no of white hats after listening to ans of 10th prisoner. If hats are even it 
  means he has the same color hat else it is the opposite color hat.
4.Now all other prisoner will keep making the count as odd or even depending on the previous prisoners answer.
5.This way, all prisoner will be able to guess the color of their hats correctly accept the 10th prisoner as, which will be having 50% probability.

  eg:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
       B  W  W  B  W  B  B  B  B  w
       
       For 10th prisoner: number of white hats in front of him: 3(odd), so he will say white (50% probability)
       For 9th: number of white hats in front of him: 3(odd), as the 10th prisoner said white so it is black hat on his head.
       same for the next 3 prisoners also.
       For 5th prisioner: number of white hats as 2:(even), so he must be having white hat on him.
       and so on...
       
       (Prisioners will discuss this before the jailor comes that what color to say if they see even no of white hats)

2. Variant of 10 prisoners

  strategy:
1. Label the colors {1,2,3}. The 10th prisioner says the sum of the hats in front of him.
   After this the 9th one can get which number corresponds to the color of his hat (by subtracting the sum that he can
   see minus the sum previously said).
2. The next one, having heard all of this, can now get the sum of the last n−2 people, and by substracting this from the sum
   of the hats he sees (last n−3) he can get which hat he has. 
3. And so on...

3. N prisioners with k colors of hats

   strategy:
1. Label the colors {1,2,3...k}. The nth prisioner says the sum of the hats in front of him.
   After this the (n-1)th one can get which number corresponds to the color of his hat (by subtracting the sum that he can
   see minus the sum previously said).
2. The next one, having heard all of this, can now get the sum of the last n−2 people, and by substracting this from the sum
   of the hats he sees (last n−3) he can get which hat he has.
3. similarly all will follow same procedure, just the probability of first one is 50%.

4. Counterfeit coin

  stategy:
  Divide 12 coins in 3 piles of 4 coins name them A,B and C respectively.
  
  weighing 1:
  we will weigh A and B.
  A=B or A>B , A<B
  
  Case 1: A=B 
weighing 2: Means C has the unequal coin. Now  put 3 coins from A on left side of the balance and 3 coins from C.
   if A=C : unequal coins is the 4th coin we do not used from C.
   if A<C : The unequal coin is heavier and among those 3 coins from C.

          weighing 3: Now take 2 coins from those 3 coins of C and put 1-1 each on balance.
            if equal weight: The leftover 3rd coin is unequal coin.
            else the heavier one is the unequal coin.
    .........................
    
    Case 2: A>B 
weighing 2: Now weigh B and C
     if B=C then A contains the unequal coin and coin is heavier.
          weighing 3: Take 3 coins from A and same procedure as followed in Case 1.

     if C>B then B contains the unequal coin and is lighter
          weighing 3: Take 3 coins from A and same procedure as followed in Case 1. 

  ..........................
  
  Case 3: A<B
weighing 2: Now weigh B and C
  And same procedure as in Case 2.
  
  In this way we can find the coin in 3 weighing.
